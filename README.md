# Spring MVC 



# How to use 

1. just clone it and import/open it into your IDE (like `IntelliJ` or `NetBeans`) and then simply run it (your IDE will automatically compile and deploye it on your web service) 

2. you can also compile it using maven with following command:

   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

   then copy the `.war` file (which will be created in `target` folder) and deploy it on your web server like `tomcat`
